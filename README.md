### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a Senior Product Learning Specialist at [SAP](https://github.com/sap), Iâ€™m a advisor and advocate for the SAP developer community, blending technical expertise, deep product knowledge, and engaging speaking skills to support developers through their learning journeys, overcoming challenges, and achieving SAP certifications worldwide.

My work focuses on developing premier online content and learning experiences for developers of the SAP BTP, specifically within cloud-native application development, leveraging the CAP-framework, SAP Business Application Studio, Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, Kyma, and the intuitive SAP Build platform.

Aside my full-time professional duties at SAP, Iâ€™m deepening my expertise through a full-time B.Sc. in Business Informatics at the IU International University of Applied Sciences, where I specialize in Deep Learning and Business Management. Some of my machine learning research projects can be found here on GitHub.

**Note**: My personal projects on GitHub are not associated with SAP. All views are my own.
